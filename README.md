# YoutubedGUI
A simple youtube music downloader(GUI) using python.


I had some free time(not really). So I made it ig. IDK man. Anyway, just download it as zip, extract, run install.py then run YoutubedGUI.py. The rest you'll get by yourself.

It was made literally in two days. So it's gonna be buggy as hell bruh.
